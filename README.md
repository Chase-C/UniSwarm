Sound-of-Circles
================

A simple circle-circle collision simulator with a twist. Written in javascript.

I've only tested it in Firefox and Chrome, so I don't know if it will work
properly in Safari, Opera, or whatever else people use.

In Chrome, the audio doesn't work quite right. There are strange jitters and
artifacts. I think that it's a problem with Chrome itself, but it could be my
implementation or the audio library I use, Thunder.js.
