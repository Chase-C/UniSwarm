UniSwarm
========

A minimalistic RTS game created in 2 days for the Ludum Dare 28.

You control one planet among many as well as all the units it produces.   
Here's how to play:
+ Click and hold on your planet (colored red) in order to withdraw units.
+ Select units by moving the cursor over them while holding the left mouse button.
+ Send selected units to neighboring planets by right clicking.
+ Opposing units will automatically attack each other if they are near.
+ A planet will produce units at a speed proportional to its size. When your planet starts shrinking, migrate to a new one by withdrawing all your units and sending them somewhere more suitable (a currently growing planet is a good choice).
+ You win by destroying all of the enemy's units.
